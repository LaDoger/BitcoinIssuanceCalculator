Bitcoin Issuance Calculator is a web tool to help you estimate the date and time a certain Bitcoin block will be mined.


You can estimate based on:

- A certain block height (e.g. Block #1,050,000)

- A certain amount of BTC mined (e.g. 20,000,000 $BTC)

- A certain percentage of BTC mined (e.g. 99%)
